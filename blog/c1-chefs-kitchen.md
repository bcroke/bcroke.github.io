Title: Dev Bootcamp's Culture - One of the Best Places on Earth

Subtitle: The school of the future is less about curriculum and more about culture

Date: 10/12/14

If you ever get the chance to visit any of Dev Bootcamp's campuses I highly recommend it.

Walking through the doors you are hit with an aliveness of a collective energy of a gropu of people who are there to do something.

They're not there to watch a sports game or get a free lunch students are there to learn. After seeing this energy first hand I was sold. This was the learning environment of the future.

Since joining Dev Bootcamp as a staff member and now joining DBC as a student in Phase 0, I'm excited to take part in the restaurant. For the past year I've been dining at the DBC table without really knowing what it takes to cook the food if you catch my analogy.

I've been more or less waiting tables. I explain menue items, I encourage patrons to go into the kitchen, and sometimes I'll go back there myself and help out a little here or there. As a student I now have much more empathy for the people and community I've been supporting.

I'm excited to take more of an active role in the community and finally learning some of this programming stuff myself. Cheers to being in the kitchen.
