Title: Making it through week 1 of Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0

Subtitle: You think you know, when you have no idea

Date: 10/12/14

Welcome to the wonderful world of programming at Dev Bootcamp. In this short blog post I'm going to talk a little bit about git and GitHub, but first a little story.

When you work in tech often times you'll hear phrases like "JSON Object" and you won't know what they mean, but you end up repeating it sometime (I call this translating) to someone else that 'this' is what 'this' thing is, without ever really understanding the thing.

I use JSON object as an example because last week I was told by a DBC instructor that although people use that phrase it actually makes no sense (I'm not exactly sure why) and so you shouldn't go around saying it. For a while I used to think Git was just the shorthand for Github. Turns out that's not the case.

Git is a version control system which keeps track of all the changes you make when programming or even writing a blog like this one. There are all these fancy git commands which allow you to create, copy and update files and they store and track all of these changes for you.

GitHub on the other hand is a website online that stores all your code. When you work in a team or at a company all your code will be stored on GitHub and you can "push" and "pull" changes with Git in order for you all to work together.

I think of Git like when you can look at all the past "track changes" on a microsoft word or google doc. GitHub is more like a cocktail party where everyone can store, share and edit their individual doc's with one another using Git commands.

That's the best anology I have to explain those concepts. Promise these posts will git more interesting as time goes on. See what I did there?
